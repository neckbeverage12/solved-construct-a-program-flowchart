Construct a program flowchart and corresponding pseudocode to solve the following problem: You are in a pumpkin patch looking for the great pumpkin. The first input record indicates how many pumpkin weight records follow. Several input records, each containing the weight of a pumpkin, follow the first input record. Assume that all the pumpkin weights are greater than 0. You are to find the largest weight and the average weight of all the pumpkins. You are to output each weight, as well as the largest weight and the average weight. Include an initial IFTHENELSE control structure in your design that will output a descriptive message if the header record indicates that there are no input records to process.
